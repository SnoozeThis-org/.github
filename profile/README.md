SnoozeThis is a bot that holds on to your blocked issues. By telling SnoozeThis
the dependencies of your blocked issue, SnoozeThis will take over and monitor
them for you. You can snooze issues waiting for time, other issues, issues on
gitlab, docker containers and [many more](https://www.snoozethis.com/commands).

Here's a screenshot of basic usage:
